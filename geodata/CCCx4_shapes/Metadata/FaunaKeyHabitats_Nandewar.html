Data Set Source: Interpretation from Land and Property Information (LPI) 1:25 000  and 1:50,000 colour photographs. The dataset was developed as part of the Nandewar WRA vegetation project and the DIPNR Statewide Vegetation Mapping Project. Interpretation was conventional, with polygon development based on homogenous overstorey patterns discernible on the aerial photograph. Polygon linework was ascribed directly to clear acetate overlays. Each polygon was coded uniquely and the attributes were recorded on a separate data sheet.



Additional Processing Steps: Linework scanned to JPEG image format and rectified. Images were vectorised in Arcview Spatial analyst. Raw linework was edited and polygons built using ArcView (Edit tools v2) and Arc/Info 8.3. Attribution of polygons using Arcview and MS Access.

Final validation of data using Arcview.



2) Large key habitats were initially identified as those inter-connected polygons with a canopy cover of greater than 20% which in total comprised an area greater than 1,000 ha. This area was considered sufficient to support core habitat of species with large home ranges such as the barking owl. These areas were then reviewed by experts in the fauna of the region. Since two-thirds of the vegetation of the region has been cleared, most large forest blocks were included as key habitats. Some were excluded on the basis that their shape was too fragmented for them to act as consolidated habitat.



3) Small key habitats were identified as remnant patches greater than 50ha and exhibiting one or more of the following criteria:



 Occurrence on fertile soils. This was estimated using a combination of geology and terrain as a surrogate for soil fertility. Fertile areas were defined as the most fertile 20% of the region, which has been over 90% cleared. 

 Patches of grassy white box, yellow box or grey box were included as these box woodlands were likely to have been a major habitat of the historic Nandewar landscape. Although now largely cleared, the remaining patches are still of considerable value.

 Mugga ironbark was included as it is a major nectar-producing and hollow-forming species recognised as important for vertebrate fauna. Although likely to have been historically less widespread than the grassy box communities, and has also been heavily cleared, it remains an important resource.

 River red gum, which is also important for nectar and hollows and is a key component of riparian habitat on fertile soils. Most of this habitat has also been cleared or highly degraded.

 Dry rainforest and semi-evergreen vine thicket is included as it is a rare habitat and a number of vertebrates appear to be loosely associated with dry rainforest vegetation elements.

4) The key habitats were reviewed by experts in the fauna of the region using the fauna survey results of the five-year Nandewar survey program conducted by the Department of Environment and Conservation. Remnants known to be important from the field surveys were added and others removed.



5) A final check was undertaken, primarily using Landsat imagery, particularly concentrating on the shape and condition of the patches identified.



6) Key habitat sub-regions were identified. These are areas of similar biophysical characteristics (geology, climate, terrain, vegetation and spatial location). For each of the 15 sub-regions, the threatened species known to occur, likely to occur and potentially occurring have been tabulated from survey data, Atlas of NSW Wildlife data and expert knowledge. The species lists are in the Attachment below. They are indicative only. For any particular key habitat they are a guide that must be used in conjunction with a consideration of local habitat characteristics.

	

Positional accuracy:



Accurate to the limits of the API. 

	

For the API, horizontal linework accuracy is estimated to be within 37.5 metres for mapping from 1:25 000 aerial photos.

	

The mapped API boundaries were ortho-rectified. Ground Control Points (GCP's) were referenced from 1:25 000 digital topographic maps. LPI's 25m DEM was utilised for terrain adjustment and subsequently any vertical accuracy measure should be commensurate with DEM accuracy. Each orthorectified photo/overlay was verified against a Level 10 orthorectifed Landsat TM image and matched if a consistent spatial shift across the overlay/photo was encountered. Both the 20m resolution multispectral and 10m resolution panchromatic bands were used for assessing spatial shift.



Fauna record accuracy for the majority of species was restricted to those records accurate to 100m. For a number of rare species, records accurate to 1km were used.



Attribute Accuracy:



The accuracy of attributing vegetation communities is between 80-97% within the extent of existing vegetation, indicating that on at least 4 of 5 occasions, a vegetation type on the ground will be consistent with the model (on the basis of canopy floristics).



There has been no formal scientific assessment of the accuracy of attributing a vegetation remnant as key habitat. From experience in the region, it is highly likely that the larger key habitats will be important for many species due to the loss of native vegetation in the bioregion, and that small remnants of critically depleted habitat are also important, particularly for future habitat restoration. However, there is an inherent variability between species in predicting their use of habitat in different areas and considerable additional survey work would need to be carried out for a more rigorous accuracy assessment.



Logical Consistency:



The data layer has been checked (and modified where necessary) against contextual background layers such a Landsat images and fertility layers.



Completeness:



The dataset is complete for the study area.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold; ">Scope:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span></span>dataset<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold; ">Completeness:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br><br><span style="font-weight:bold; ">Logical consistency:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br><br><span style="font-weight:bold; ">Positional accuracy:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br><br><span style="font-weight:bold; ">Attribute accuracy:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accuracy of attributing vegetation communities is between 80-97% within the extent of existing vegetation, indicating that on at least 4 of 5 occasions, a vegetation type on the ground will be consistent with the model (on the basis of canopy floristics).
